(Redirected from Flags of formerly independent states)

This gallery contains the flags of states that were
(at least de facto) independent in the past.

The independence of many of these states has not been acknowledged,
but the flags had been used as their state/national flags.

Several of these flags are currently used,
either by secessionist movements or
officially by regional authorities.

For historical flags of current countries,
see w:Timeline of national flags
