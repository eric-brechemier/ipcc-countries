Description:
There are 197 sovereign states in the world.
Country subdivisions and the smallest map units.

Small scale data, 1:110m
Suitable for schematic maps of the world on a postcard
or as a small locator globe.

1:110,000,000
1″ = 1,736 miles
1 cm = 1,100 km

Tiny country points: Some countries don’t read well
on thematic choropleth data maps.
Color code the dots with the same information as the larger country polygons
to communicate data that would otherwise be lost.

Same as the 50m tiny countries, except filtered where [ScaleRank] <= 2.

Disclaimer:
Natural Earth Vector draws boundaries of sovereign states
according to defacto status.
We show who actually controls the situation on the ground.
For instance, we show China and Taiwan as two separate states.
But we show Palestine as part of Israel.
Please feel free to mashup our countries and disputed areas themes
to match your particular political outlook.
