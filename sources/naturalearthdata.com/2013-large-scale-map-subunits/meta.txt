Map subunits: (...) Alaska and United States
(lower 48 states + the District of Columbia).

Countries subdivided by non-contiguous units.
Mainland metropolitan France separate from the island of Corsica.
These rarely correspond to actual administrative divisions
but rather highlight geographical regions
that are not continuous but are part of the same country.

Disclaimer:
Natural Earth Vector draws boundaries of sovereign states
according to defacto status.
We show who actually controls the situation on the ground.
For instance, we show China and Taiwan as two separate states.
But we show Palestine as part of Israel.
Please feel free to mashup our countries and disputed areas themes
to match your particular political outlook.
