Tiny country points: Some countries don’t read well on thematic choropleth
data maps. Color code the dots with the same information as the larger country
polygons to communicate data that would otherwise be lost.

Disclaimer:
Natural Earth Vector draws boundaries of sovereign states
according to defacto status.
We show who actually controls the situation on the ground.
For instance, we show China and Taiwan as two separate states.
But we show Palestine as part of Israel.
Please feel free to mashup our countries and disputed areas themes
to match your particular political outlook.
