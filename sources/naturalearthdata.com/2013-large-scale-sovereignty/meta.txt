Sovereign states: (...) France and it’s territories.

There are fewer sovereign states than ISO country codes.
Sovereign States do not distinguish between the metropolitan
and semi-independent portions of a state or it’s constituent countries.
Passports are issued by sovereign states, not countries.

Disclaimer:
Natural Earth Vector draws boundaries of sovereign states
according to defacto status.
We show who actually controls the situation on the ground.
For instance, we show China and Taiwan as two separate states.
But we show Palestine as part of Israel.
Please feel free to mashup our countries and disputed areas themes
to match your particular political outlook.
