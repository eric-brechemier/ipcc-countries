  <title>How does a country become a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)?</title>
  <desc>Any state which is member of the United Nations (UN) or of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) becomes de facto a member of the IPCC. UN embers are all states, but WMO members can be states or territories. Only the states, not the territories, are IPCC members.</desc>
